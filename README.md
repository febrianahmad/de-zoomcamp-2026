This repository contains coursework and hands-on projects completed during the DataTalksClub Data Engineering Zoomcamp program.

🚀 Data Engineering Zoomcamp — Assignments Repository

This repository contains assignments, exercises, and mini projects that I completed as part of the DataTalksClub Data Engineering Zoomcamp.

The main goals of this repository are to:
Document my learning journey in data engineering
Store implementations from each module
Serve as a personal reference (and hopefully useful for others as well)

📚 Topics Covered

Some of the topics included in this repository:
Data ingestion and pipelines (batch & streaming)
ETL / ELT workflows
Data warehousing and analytics engineering
Workflow orchestration
Cloud infrastructure for data pipelines

🛠️ Tech Stack (will grow over time):
Python
SQL
Docker
dbt
Cloud services (GCP and others depending on the module)

⚠️ Notes:
The folder structure and contents may change as the course progresses.
Most of the code here is written for learning purposes, so it may not always follow production best practices.
