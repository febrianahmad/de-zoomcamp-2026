Question 7. Which of the following sequences describes the Terraform workflow for: 1) Downloading plugins and setting up backend, 2) Generating and executing changes, 3) Removing all resources?

Terraform lifecycle:
Initialize (init) the working directory and providers.
Generate & execute (apply) infrastructure changes, -auto-approve skips confirmation and executes immediately.
Cleanup (destroy) managed infrastructure.

SO THE ANSWER ACCORDING TO THE TERRAFORM LIFECYCLE ABOVE IS...

terraform import, terraform apply -y, terraform destroy
teraform init, terraform plan -auto-apply, terraform rm
terraform init, terraform run -auto-approve, terraform destroy
terraform init, terraform apply -auto-approve, terraform destroy (the answer)
terraform import, terraform apply -y, terraform rm
